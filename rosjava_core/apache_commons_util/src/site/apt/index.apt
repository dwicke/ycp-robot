About Apache WS Common Utilities

  This is a small collection of utility classes, that allow high performance XML
  processing based on SAX. Basically, it is assumed, that you are using an JAXP
  1.1 compliant XML parser and nothing else. In particular, no dependency on the
  javax.xml.transform package is introduced.
